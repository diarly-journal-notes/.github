## About Diarly
Diarly is a dedicated journaling application designed for users who value privacy, consistency, and thoughtful reflection in their writing practice. It provides a secure, focused environment for personal journaling, combining the tactile pleasure of traditional journaling with the advantages of digital organization and searchability. The application addresses common barriers to consistent journaling by offering gentle reminders, writing statistics, and visual progress tracking that encourages regular writing habits. Unlike general note-taking applications, Diarly is specifically optimized for chronological, personal writing with features that support reflection, memory keeping, and personal growth tracking.

The application's distinction lies in its privacy-first approach and thoughtful design. All journal entries are encrypted on the device before being synchronized, ensuring that personal reflections remain private. The calendar view transforms journaling from a list of entries into a visual timeline of one's life, making it easy to see writing patterns and revisit specific periods. Writing tools like word count targets, writing streak tracking, and entry templates support building consistent habits. For users seeking a digital equivalent to a private diary with the added benefits of search, organization, and secure backup, Diarly provides a respectful, supportive environment for personal writing.
